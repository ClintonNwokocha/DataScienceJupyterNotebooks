# DataScienceJupyterNotebooks

Welcome to my Data Science projects repository, where I explore, analyze, and model data using Jupyter Notebooks. These notebooks provide a window into my analytical approach and problem-solving skills in the field of data science.

## Projects Overview

- `TitanicSurvivalExploration`: Exploratory data analysis and survival prediction modeling on Titanic dataset.
- `StockMarketTrends`: Time series analysis on stock market data.
- `CustomerSegmentation`: Using unsupervised learning to segment customers based on purchasing data.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Predictive modeling and machine learning
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing

Each project includes a detailed notebook that walks through the analysis step-by-step. Feedback and contributions are always welcome!
